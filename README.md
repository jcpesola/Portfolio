# My Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal corner on the web! 🌟 This project is my first-ever website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It’s a digital canvas where I showcase my journey as a full-stack developer, architect, and artist—combining creativity and code to tell my story.
